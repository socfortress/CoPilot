## Getting started

CoPilot's true power comes from the ability to integrate with your existing security stack. We have built-in integrations with the following tools:

- [Wazuh](https://wazuh.com/)
- [Graylog](https://www.graylog.org/)
- [Velociraptor](https://docs.velociraptor.app/)
- [Grafana](https://grafana.com/)
- [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/)

❗️ **Note:** CoPilot is currently in beta. We are actively working on adding more integrations and features. If you have any suggestions or feedback, please let us know!

### Install / Upgrade

All install + upgrade instructions live in the docs (so the README doesn’t drift):

- **Install / Upgrade docs:** [`docs/getting-started/install-upgrade.mdx`](docs/getting-started/install-upgrade.mdx)

Quick upgrade reminder (from your CoPilot directory):

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

## Connectors

CoPilot is designed to be a single pane of glass for your security operations. Think of it as a hub for all your security tools. CoPilot Connectors are the glue that binds your security tools to CoPilot. We take advantage of the APIs and webhooks provided by your security tools to provide a seamless integration.
