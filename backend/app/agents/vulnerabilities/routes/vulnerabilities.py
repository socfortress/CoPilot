    **Features:**
    - Real-time data directly from Wazuh indexer
    - Advanced filtering by customer, agent, severity, CVE, or package
    - Efficient pagination for large result sets
    - No database storage required
    - Optional EPSS scoring integration

    **Performance:**
    - Handles large datasets efficiently with pagination
    - Optimized Elasticsearch queries for fast response times
    - Automatic sorting by EPSS score (highest to lowest) when include_epss=True
    - Falls back to detection date and severity sorting when include_epss=False
    - EPSS scoring can be disabled for faster response times

    **Filtering Options:**
    - **customer_code**: Filter by specific customer
    - **agent_name**: Filter by specific agent hostname
    - **severity**: Filter by vulnerability severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
    - **cve_id**: Search for specific CVE identifier
    - **package_name**: Filter by package name (supports partial matching)

    **EPSS Integration:**
    - **include_epss**: Include EPSS scores and percentiles for vulnerabilities
    - Provides risk assessment data from FIRST.org
    - Results are automatically sorted by EPSS score (highest to lowest)
    - May impact response time due to external API calls

    **Pagination:**
    - **page**: Page number (starts at 1)
    - **page_size**: Results per page (1-1000, default: 50)

    **Sorting Behavior:**
    - When **include_epss=True**: Results sorted by EPSS score (highest to lowest), then by severity, then by CVE ID
