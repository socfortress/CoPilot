title: Customer Portal
description: Optional customer-facing UI for MSSPs to share alerts/cases, collaborate with customers, and provide real-time visibility.
---

CoPilot’s **Customer Portal** is an **optional module** designed to bridge the gap between your internal SOC team (the CoPilot “admin” UI) and your external customers.

It gives customers a clean, scoped interface to:

- View **alerts** and **cases** that apply to *their* tenant
- Collaborate via **comments** (two-way)
- Track **status** updates (open/closed)
- View **agents/endpoints** associated with their tenant
- Share/receive **case files** (uploads)

> Security note: treat the Customer Portal as an Internet-facing app **only** when it’s deployed behind a WAF / reverse proxy (and ideally a VPN). If you find security issues, please open a GitHub issue so we can address them.

## Architecture (high level)

- **CoPilot Admin UI**: for internal SOC/admin work (full platform visibility)
- **Customer Portal UI**: separate container/service with limited customer-facing functionality

In Docker Compose, the Customer Portal runs as a **separate service** (separate container) and is typically bound to its own port (commonly `8443`).

---

## Enable the Customer Portal (Docker Compose)

1) Edit your `docker-compose.yml` and uncomment/add the `copilot-customer-portal` service.

Example:

```yaml
copilot-customer-portal:
  image: ghcr.io/socfortress/copilot-customer-portal:latest
  environment:
    - SERVER_HOST=${SERVER_HOST:-localhost}
  ports:
    - "8443:443"
  restart: always
```

2) Pull + start:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

3) Access:

- `https://<your_instance_ip_or_hostname>:8443`

> Recommendation: expose **only** the Customer Portal externally (not the admin UI), and front it with a WAF/reverse proxy.

---

## Customize branding (title + logo)

In the **CoPilot Admin UI**, there is a **Customer Portal** section where you can:

- Set the portal **title**
- Upload/update the portal **logo**

These changes are reflected in the customer-facing portal.

---

## Create Customer Portal users

Customer users are created in the **CoPilot Admin UI**:

1. Go to **Users**
2. **Create user**
3. Select role: `customer_user`
4. Set an initial password (user can change after first login)

### Assign a user to a customer (tenant)

After creating the user, **assign them to one or more customers**. Their portal view will only show alerts/cases/agents for the customer(s) they’re assigned.

---

## Collaboration model (alerts + cases)

### Comments (two-way)

- SOC analysts can comment on an alert/case in the admin UI
- Customers can reply from the Customer Portal
- Both sides see the same comment thread

### Status updates

Customers can update alert status (for example, closing an alert after validating remediation). The SOC side will see that status change.

### Case files

Cases support file uploads, enabling you to share deliverables/evidence with the customer (and vice versa).
