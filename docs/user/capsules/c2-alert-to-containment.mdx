## Goal
Contain the host quickly, preserve evidence, then work the investigation to full containment.

## When to use
- Alerts indicating command-and-control (C2) / beaconing

## Prereqs
- Alert routing into CoPilot is working
- Ability to isolate/quarantine endpoints (if enabled)

## Procedure (high level)
1) Confirm scope (customer, host, user)
2) Contain first (isolate/quarantine where appropriate)
3) Pivot into surrounding events + endpoint evidence
4) Create/attach a case and document actions

## Validation
- Host is contained
- Evidence captured and case notes updated

## Safety notes
- Prefer containment that preserves volatile evidence when possible.
