## Goal
Identify suspicious scheduled tasks used for persistence and remove them safely.

## When to use
- Alerts indicating scheduled task creation/modification

## Prereqs
- Endpoint telemetry (Windows) + investigation pivots

## Procedure (high level)
1) Triage the alert and identify the host/user/process context
2) Enumerate scheduled tasks on the endpoint
3) Identify suspicious task(s) and associated binaries/commands
4) Contain/remediate and document

## Validation
- Suspicious task removed/disabled
- Follow-on telemetry confirms no re-creation
