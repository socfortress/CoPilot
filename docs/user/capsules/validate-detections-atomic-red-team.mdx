## Goal
Simulate attacker behaviors and verify detections + routing end-to-end.

## When to use
- After deploying/tuning detection rules
- After telemetry changes (Sysmon, agent configs)

## Prereqs
- Atomic Red Team available on a test endpoint
- Velociraptor artifacts to execute tests remotely

## Procedure (high level)
1) Pick a safe atomic test
2) Execute it via CoPilot/Velociraptor
3) Confirm the expected alert fires
4) Tune rules/telemetry if needed

## Validation
- Alert fires and is visible in the expected UI surface(s)
