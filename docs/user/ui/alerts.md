# Alerts

**Menu:** Alerts

**Best for:** Admin/Engineer + Detection engineering + SOC leadership

This section is oriented around **high-level alert visibility and validation** (not the day-to-day alert triage queue).

These pages are **not** the same as [Incident alerts](/user/ui/incident-alerts). Incident Management is where analysts/operators typically work alerts.

## Sub-pages

- SIEM
- MITRE ATT&CK
- Atomic Red Team
