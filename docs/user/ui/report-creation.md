# Report creation

**Menu:** Report Creation

**Best for:** SOC operators / analysts + SOC leadership

CoPilot supports three report types:

1) **General reports**: snapshots Grafana dashboard panels and generates a PDF
2) **Vulnerability reports**: pulls vulnerability data from the **Wazuh Vulnerability Detection** module
3) **SCA reports**: pulls hardening/compliance results from the **Wazuh SCA** module

## Choose the report type

Use the Report Creation area to select which report you want to generate:

- [General reports](/user/ui/report-general)
- [Vulnerability reports](/user/ui/report-vulnerability)
- [SCA reports](/user/ui/report-sca)

Tip:
- Use **General reports** for executive summaries and “what did we see?” dashboards.
- Use **Vulnerability/SCA** reports for operational security posture and remediation tracking.
