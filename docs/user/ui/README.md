# UI Guide (mirrors the CoPilot menu)

This section is organized to match the left navigation in CoPilot.

Use it when you know **where you are in the UI** and want to understand:
- what the page is for
- who it’s for (Operator vs Admin/Engineer)
- common workflows and gotchas

If you’re brand new, start with:
- [Quickstart (Operators)](../operators-quickstart.md)
- [Quickstart (Admins/Engineers)](../admins-quickstart.md)
