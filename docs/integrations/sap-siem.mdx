# SAP SIEM (Customer Data Cloud)

## What this integration is

This integration collects **audit events** from SAP Customer Data Cloud (Gigya) and forwards them into your SOCFortress SIEM stack.

It may also support higher-level detections such as:
- multiple logins detection
- suspicious login detection
