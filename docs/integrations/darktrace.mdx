title: Darktrace
description: Ingest Darktrace alert logs (AI Analyst / Model Breach / System Status) into the SOCFortress SIEM stack.
---

## What this integration is

This integration ingests **Darktrace** alert logs into your SOCFortress SIEM stack.

Darktrace provides multiple event types that can be useful for SOC operations:
- AI Analyst alerts
- Model breach alerts
- System status alerts

---

## Data path (how it flows)

1) Darktrace → API pull (token-authenticated)
2) CoPilot collector → SIEM ingestion
3) Optional: alerting and case workflows

---

## Credentials you’ll need

Darktrace requires an **API token pair** (Public + Private). You typically need one per Master instance.

Ways to obtain tokens:

### Per-user token
1) Enable “API Access” for a local user (Threat Visualizer → Admin → Permissions)
2) Log in as that user → Account Settings → generate API tokens

### Global token
1) Threat Visualizer → System Config → Settings → generate API tokens

---

## CoPilot setup (recommended workflow)

1) Provision the customer.
2) Add **Darktrace** integration under the customer.
3) Provide the Darktrace API endpoint + token pair.
4) Validate alerts begin flowing.

---

## Success criteria

- [ ] AI Analyst / Model Breach alerts show up in the SIEM
- [ ] Events are associated with the correct customer

---

## Troubleshooting

- Confirm the user used for token creation has API access enabled.
- Confirm tokens are stored correctly and haven’t been rotated.
- Validate time range/polling schedule in the collector.
