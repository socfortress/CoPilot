# Bitdefender (GravityZone)

## What this integration is

This integration ingests **Bitdefender GravityZone** security events into your SIEM stack using GravityZone’s **Event Push Service**.

In SOCFortress CoPilot deployments, Bitdefender typically pushes events to a small HTTP receiver/connector, which then forwards them to **Graylog** over syslog.

---

## Data path (how it flows)

1) Bitdefender GravityZone (cloud) → **Event Push Service**
2) Event Push Service → **CoPilot-hosted HTTP receiver** (connector)
3) Receiver → **Graylog input** (syslog)
4) Graylog → stream/index/dashboards (provisioned)
5) Optional: Graylog alerting → Incident ingestion (if configured)

---

## Prerequisites

- Bitdefender API access is enabled and an API client is created.
- Network path is in place so Bitdefender can reach your HTTP receiver.
- You have a target syslog host/port (Graylog input).

Vendor reference:
- Event Push Service API connector (CEF): https://www.bitdefender.com/business/support/en/77209-144080-build-an-event-push-service-api-connector-for-cef-standard.html

---

## Credentials & configuration you’ll need

From Bitdefender:
- API credentials / auth string (connector uses an `authentication_string`)

From your SIEM:
- Graylog host + port (syslog target)

From your deployment:
- A public-facing DNS/port so Bitdefender can deliver events to the receiver

Example receiver config (for context; CoPilot provisioning typically generates this for you):

```json
{
  "port": 3200,
  "syslog_port": 10514,
  "transport": "Tcp",
  "target": "YOUR_GRAYLOG_SERVER",
  "authentication_string": "Basic <base64>",
  "secure": {
    "enabled": true,
    "key": "api/config/server.key",
    "cert": "api/config/server.crt"
  }
}
```

---

## CoPilot setup (recommended workflow)

1) **Provision the customer** first (so the tenant wiring exists).
2) In CoPilot, open the customer and add the **Bitdefender** integration.
3) Enter the required configuration values.
4) Deploy/start the Bitdefender connector container generated during provisioning.

Provisioning typically creates:
- Graylog CEF/syslog input
- Graylog stream + index
- Grafana datasource + dashboards
- Bitdefender docker compose + config

---

## Deployment notes (connector container)

In a standard layout, provisioning creates a customer-specific folder under:
- `/opt/CoPilot/data/data/<CUSTOMER_NAME>/`

Start the connector:

```bash
docker compose -f /opt/CoPilot/data/data/<CUSTOMER_NAME>/<CUSTOMER_NAME>_bitdefender_docker-compose.yml up -d
```

---

## Success criteria

- [ ] Bitdefender events are arriving in Graylog
- [ ] Events are routed to the customer’s index/stream
- [ ] Dashboards show non-empty data (after a short delay)

---

## Troubleshooting

- Verify inbound firewall/NAT allows Bitdefender → HTTP receiver traffic.
- Verify the receiver can reach Graylog syslog input (host/port).
- Validate TLS cert/key configuration if `secure.enabled=true`.
- Confirm auth string matches what Bitdefender expects.
