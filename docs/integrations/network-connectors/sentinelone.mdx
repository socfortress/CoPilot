description: Forward SentinelOne alerts/events to the SIEM using TLS (mutual auth).

## What this connector is

This connector forwards **SentinelOne** alerts and events to your SIEM using **TLS-encrypted syslog** with **mutual authentication**.

Detailed guide:

## Architecture

```
SentinelOne Cloud → TLS (mutual auth) → SIEM Stack
```

---

## Setup steps (high level)

### 1) Configure Syslog integration in SentinelOne

- Log into the SentinelOne console
- Go to **Settings → Integrations**
- Select **Syslog**

Set:
- **Host:** SIEM FQDN/IP
- **Port:** typically 6514 for TLS
- Enable **Use TLS secure connection**
- Syslog format: **RFC-5424**

### 2) Upload certificates (mutual TLS)

You’ll typically upload:
- Root CA certificate
- Client certificate
- Client private key

### 3) Firewall rules

Ensure inbound rules allow SentinelOne cloud endpoints to reach your syslog listener, and that internal routing allows traffic to Graylog.

### 4) Select event types

In the integration’s Notifications tab, select which event categories to forward.

### 5) Test

Use **Test Connection** and confirm events arrive in the SIEM.

## Troubleshooting

- TLS handshake failures: validate PEM formats, chain, and expiry.
- Missing events: confirm event types selected + verify ingestion parsing.
- Connectivity: confirm firewall/NAT and correct port.
