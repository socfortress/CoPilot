title: SonicWall (syslog)
description: Forward SonicWall firewall logs to the SIEM via direct syslog or syslog-ng with TLS.
---

## What this connector is

This connector covers two approaches for forwarding **SonicWall** logs to your SIEM:

1) Direct syslog forwarding (UDP/TCP)
2) Syslog-NG collector (local UDP) → TLS forwarding (recommended for production)

Direct syslog guide:

## Method 1: Direct syslog forwarding (UDP/TCP)

1) Log into SonicWall web management UI
2) Go to **Log → Settings → Syslog**
3) Enable syslog
4) Configure syslog server:
   - Host/IP
   - Port
   - Format (Syslog or CEF)
   - Optional Syslog ID
5) Select log categories (attacks, drops, user activity, etc.)
6) Apply/Accept

Validate logs arrive in the SIEM.

## Method 2: Syslog-NG collector (recommended)

### Architecture

```
SonicWall (UDP) → Syslog-NG Collector (local) → TLS → SIEM Stack
```

### Steps (high level)

1) Deploy a local syslog-ng collector:
   - https://socfortress.supportbench.net/article/local-log-collector-using-syslog-ng

2) Point SonicWall syslog destination to the **local collector IP**

3) Configure syslog-ng to forward via **TLS** to the SIEM

4) Verify end-to-end flow:
   - collector receiving
   - TLS connection established
   - SIEM receiving and parsing

---

## Notes

- If logs traverse the internet, prefer TLS forwarding.
- Keep NTP/time sync correct.
- Monitor log volume.
