# Fortinet FortiGate (syslog)

## What you get (high level)

- Firewall traffic logs
- Threat/UTM logs (depending on FortiGate config)
- Admin/audit events (optional)

## Data path (how it flows)

FortiGate → syslog → ingestion/collector → Graylog parsing/routing → storage/indexing → alerts (`gl-events*`) → CoPilot Alerts/Cases.

## Setup (wireframe)

- Configure FortiGate to send syslog to your collector.
- Ensure parsing and tenant-aware routing are in place.

## Success criteria

- [ ] You can find fresh FortiGate events
- [ ] You can identify the sending device
- [ ] Events are tenant-aware

## Starter alerts

- Excessive denies from a single source
- Inbound connections to sensitive services
- Admin login/config change events

## Troubleshooting

- Confirm FortiGate syslog destination and facility/severity
- Confirm the collector is reachable from the FortiGate
- Confirm key parsing fields exist downstream
