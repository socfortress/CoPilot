## What you get (high level)

- Traffic logs
- Threat logs
- System logs (optional)

## Data path (how it flows)

PAN-OS → syslog → ingestion/collector → Graylog parsing/routing → storage/indexing → alerts (`gl-events*`) → CoPilot Alerts/Cases.

## Setup (wireframe)

- Configure PAN-OS to export syslog.
- Confirm parsing and tenant-aware routing.

## Success criteria

- [ ] You can find fresh PAN logs
- [ ] You can identify source device
- [ ] Events are tenant-aware

## Starter alerts

- Threat log severity thresholding (high/critical)
- Repeated denies/drops from a single source
- Admin login/config change events

## Troubleshooting

- Confirm syslog profile and server configuration
- Confirm connectivity and UDP/TCP choice
- Confirm parsing fields exist
