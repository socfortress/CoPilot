# Cisco ASA (syslog)

## What you get (high level)

- Firewall connection logs
- ACL denies/permits
- VPN-related logs (optional)

## Data path (how it flows)

ASA → syslog → ingestion/collector → Graylog parsing/routing → storage/indexing → alerts (`gl-events*`) → CoPilot Alerts/Cases.

## Setup (wireframe)

- Configure ASA logging + syslog destination.
- Confirm downstream parsing and tenant-aware routing.

## Success criteria

- [ ] You can find fresh ASA events
- [ ] You can identify the device/source
- [ ] Events are routed to the correct customer

## Starter alerts

- Excessive denies/drops
- VPN auth failures
- Admin login/config change events

## Troubleshooting

- Confirm logging level
- Confirm syslog host and interface
- Confirm event volume is not overwhelming ingestion
