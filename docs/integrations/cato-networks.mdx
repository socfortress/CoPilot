description: Ingest Cato Networks SASE events into the SOCFortress SIEM stack.
---

## What this integration is

This integration ingests **Cato Networks** events into your SOCFortress SIEM stack using the Cato API (commonly via the `eventsFeed` capability).

Vendor reference:
- Cato API docs: https://api.catonetworks.com/documentation/

---

## Data path (how it flows)

1) Cato Networks → events API feed
2) CoPilot collector → SIEM ingestion (indexing/search)
3) Optional: alerting and incident workflows

---

## Prerequisites

- Cato Management Application access
- API key created with appropriate permissions
- Event feed enabled (Administration → Event Integrations)

---

## Credentials you’ll need

From Cato:
- **Account ID** (from the URL)
- **API key**

API key notes:
- Choose **View permissions** for read-only ingestion.
- Copy the key immediately when generated (can’t be retrieved later).

---

## CoPilot setup (recommended workflow)

1) Provision the customer.
2) Add **Cato Networks** integration under the customer.
3) Provide account ID + API key.
4) Validate that events begin flowing.

---

## Success criteria

- [ ] Events show up for the expected customer
- [ ] You can correlate an event in Cato with an event in the SIEM

---

## Troubleshooting

- Confirm “Event Feed Enabled” is toggled on.
- Confirm the API key is not expired/revoked.
- Validate the account ID is correct and in-scope.
