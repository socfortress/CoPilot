description: Ingest Huntress telemetry and operationalize it inside CoPilot.

## What this integration is

Huntress provides managed detection/response-style telemetry that can complement endpoint and identity sources.

## Data path (how it flows)

**Typical flow:**

1. Huntress → **External Service integration** (API collector or export)
2. Events → **SIEM storage** (Wazuh Indexer / OpenSearch-backed)
3. Optional: events → **Graylog** alert definitions
4. Alerts → `gl-events*` → **CoPilot Incident Management → Alerts**
5. Operator workflow → **Cases**

## What data you get (high level)

- Alerts/detections (depending on enabled exports)
- Host/agent context (depending on integration design)

## Setup (wireframe)

- Configure Huntress under **External Services / 3rd Party Integrations**.
- Ensure events are tenant-aware.

## Success criteria

- [ ] You can find at least one recent Huntress event/detection
- [ ] It is associated with the expected customer

## Dashboards

- [ ] Confirm dashboards populate (after provisioning)

## Alerts (starter set)

- High-confidence Huntress detections promoted into SOC alerting
- Repeated detections on the same host
- New persistence indicators (if present in telemetry)

## Troubleshooting

- Verify external service status
- Confirm export mechanism (API/webhook) and permissions
- Confirm routing
