# Network connectors (syslog)

Network connectors ingest **syslog events** from firewalls and network devices (and some syslog-forwarding services).

## Data path (how it flows)

**Typical flow:**

1. Network device → **syslog sender** (UDP/TCP)
2. Syslog collector/ingestion → **Graylog** (inputs/streams/pipelines)
3. Routed/normalized events → **Wazuh Indexer / OpenSearch-backed storage** (tenant-aware)
4. Graylog alert definitions → `gl-events*` → **CoPilot Incident Management → Alerts**
5. Operator workflow → **Cases**

> The key requirement in multi-tenant setups is **tenant-aware routing**.

- [Palo Alto Networks](/integrations/network-connectors/palo-alto)
- [Cisco ASA](/integrations/network-connectors/cisco-asa)

## Success criteria

- [ ] Syslog events are arriving
- [ ] You can identify the device/source
- [ ] Events are routed/tagged to the correct customer
- [ ] You can build at least one alert on top of the data (optional)

## Starter alerts (generic)

These are useful across most firewall/device syslog sources:

- Excessive denies/drops from a single source IP
- Inbound connections to sensitive ports (RDP/SSH/VPN admin)
- New admin login or configuration change event
- Threat/UTM events (if your device emits them)

## Troubleshooting

- Validate the device is sending to the correct IP/port
- Confirm the collector is listening and receiving
- Confirm parsing/extraction fields exist (vendor format)
- Confirm routing rules / customer association
