description: Ingest Carbon Black Cloud alerts into the SOCFortress SIEM stack.
---

## What this integration is

This integration ingests **VMware Carbon Black Cloud** alert data into your SOCFortress SIEM stack using the Carbon Black Cloud APIs.

---

## Data path (how it flows)

1) Carbon Black Cloud → API polling/collector
2) Collector → SIEM ingestion (indexing/search)
3) Optional: alerting + routing into Incident Management

---

## Prerequisites

- Carbon Black Cloud console access
- API access enabled

Vendor reference:
- Alerts API: https://developer.carbonblack.com/reference/carbon-black-cloud/platform/latest/alerts-api/

---

## Credentials & permissions you’ll need

From the Carbon Black Cloud console:
- API ID
- API Secret Key
- ORG Key
- ORG ID
- Base API hostname (e.g., `https://defense.conferdeploy.net`)

The recommended pattern is to create:
1) a **custom access level** with **Alerts: READ**
2) an **API key** bound to that access level

---

## CoPilot setup (recommended workflow)

1) Provision the customer (tenant wiring).
2) In CoPilot → customer → Integrations → **Add integration** → **Carbon Black**.
3) Paste the API credentials + org identifiers.
4) Deploy/start the collector/connector component (if your deployment model uses a containerized collector).

---

## Success criteria

- [ ] Carbon Black alerts are arriving
- [ ] Alerts/events are tagged to the correct customer

---

## Troubleshooting

- Confirm API key permissions include alerts read access.
- Confirm ORG identifiers match your tenant.
- Validate base URL/region (commercial vs other environments).
- Check collector logs for rate limiting/auth failures.
