# Mimecast

## What this integration is

Mimecast telemetry provides email security signals (policy actions, suspicious messages, detections) that are useful for SOC alerting and investigation.

## Data path (how it flows)

**Typical flow:**

1. Mimecast → **External Service integration** (API collector)
2. Events → **SIEM storage** (Wazuh Indexer / OpenSearch-backed)
3. Optional: events → **Graylog** alert definitions
4. Alerts → `gl-events*` → **CoPilot Incident Management → Alerts**
5. Operator workflow → **Cases**

## What data you get (high level)

- Email security events
- Policy actions / detections (depends on API endpoints enabled)

## Setup (wireframe)

- Configure Mimecast under **External Services / 3rd Party Integrations**.
- Confirm events are tenant-aware.

## Success criteria

- [ ] You can locate at least one recent Mimecast event
- [ ] Events map to the correct customer

## Dashboards

- [ ] After provisioning, confirm dashboards populate for this customer

## Alerts (starter set)

- Spike in blocked/quarantined messages
- Repeated phishing detections for a user
- High-risk sender domains or attachment types (if available)

## Troubleshooting

- Verify external service is connected/verified
- Confirm API credentials/permissions
- Confirm routing/tenant association
