# Wazuh (endpoints)

## What this integration is

Wazuh is the primary endpoint telemetry source in many CoPilot deployments.

It provides:
- endpoint security events
- agent inventory/health
- vulnerability and SCA signals (when enabled)

## Data path (how it flows)

**Typical flow:**

1. Endpoints → **Wazuh agent**
2. Wazuh Manager → decoding/rules → events
3. Events → **Wazuh Indexer / OpenSearch-backed storage**
4. Optional: events → **Graylog** for search + alerting (environment-dependent)
5. Alerts → `gl-events*` → **CoPilot Incident Management → Alerts**
6. Operator workflow → **Cases**

## Setup (wireframe)

- Configure and verify the **Wazuh connector** in CoPilot.
- Enroll at least one agent and ensure it’s tagged/routed to the correct customer context.

## Success criteria

- [ ] A test endpoint appears in CoPilot **Agents** and is online
- [ ] You can find recent endpoint events
- [ ] (Optional) You can tune detection rules and see changes reflected in alert volume

## Dashboards

After provisioning, default dashboards can be deployed per customer.

- [ ] Confirm dashboards populate for the customer (endpoint/security views)

## Alerts (starter set)

- High-severity authentication events
- Suspicious process/command execution signals (where applicable)
- Privilege changes / new admin users

## Troubleshooting

- Confirm agent enrollment and connectivity to Wazuh Manager
- Confirm indexing/storage health
- Confirm tenant routing/customer association
