## What this integration is

Office 365 (Microsoft 365) telemetry is typically **API-collected** audit/sign-in activity that becomes part of your tenant’s SIEM dataset.

## Data path (how it flows)

**Typical flow:**

1. Microsoft 365 → **External Service integration** (API collector)
2. Events → **SIEM storage** (Wazuh Indexer / OpenSearch-backed)
3. Optional: events → **Graylog** alert definitions
4. Alerts → `gl-events*` → **CoPilot Incident Management → Alerts**
5. Operator workflow → **Cases**

## What data you get (high level)

- Audit activity (user/admin activity)
- Authentication/sign-in related events (depending on collector scope)

## Setup (wireframe)

- Configure Office 365 under **External Services / 3rd Party Integrations**.
- Ensure events are **tenant-aware** (associated with the correct customer).

## Success criteria

- [ ] You can locate at least one **recent** Office 365 event in CoPilot
- [ ] The event is associated with the expected customer

## Dashboards

After provisioning, CoPilot can deploy templated dashboards for supported integrations.

- [ ] Confirm relevant Grafana dashboards for this customer are **populated** (not empty panels)

## Alerts (starter set)

- Suspicious sign-ins (impossible travel / unfamiliar location, if available)
- Admin role changes
- Mailbox forwarding / inbox rule changes
- OAuth consent / suspicious app registrations (if available)

## Troubleshooting

- Verify the external service/integration is connected and healthy
- Confirm customer code / tenant routing assumptions
- Validate the ingestion pipeline (collector → storage → CoPilot view)
