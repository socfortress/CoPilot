# Duo

## What this integration is

This integration ingests **Duo authentication and admin logs** into your SOCFortress SIEM stack via the **Duo Admin API**.

Vendor reference:
- Duo Admin API overview: https://duo.com/docs/adminapi#overview

---

## What data you get (high level)

- Authentication logs
- Telephony logs
- Administrator action logs

---

## Prerequisites

- Duo Admin Panel access
- **Owner** role (required to create/modify Admin API applications)

---

## Credentials you’ll need

From the Duo Admin Panel “Admin API” application:
- Integration key
- Secret key
- API hostname

Permissions note:
- Grant the Admin API application **read log** permissions at minimum.

---

## CoPilot setup (recommended workflow)

1) Provision the customer.
2) Add the **Duo** integration under the customer.
3) Paste the integration key/secret key/API hostname.
4) Validate logs appear in the SIEM.

---

## Security notes

Treat the Duo secret key like a password:
- store it in a secure secrets manager
- rotate if exposure is suspected

---

## Troubleshooting

- Confirm the Admin API application has the required permissions.
- Confirm the API hostname is correct for your Duo tenant.
- Check for clock drift on the collector (Duo auth is time-sensitive).
