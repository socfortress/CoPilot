# Integration name

## What this integration is

## Data path (how it flows)

**Typical flow:**

1. Source system → **collector/ingestion** (External Service, integration job, webhook, or syslog)
2. Events → **SIEM storage** (Wazuh Indexer / OpenSearch-backed)
3. Optional: events → **Graylog** for search/streaming + alert definitions
4. Alerts → `gl-events*` → **CoPilot Incident Management → Alerts**
5. Operator workflow → **Cases**, evidence, response

> Exact wiring varies by integration and environment. This section is meant to make expectations concrete.

## What data you get (high level)

## Setup (wireframe)

- Where to configure it in CoPilot
- What credentials/permissions are typically needed (high level)

## Success criteria (what “working” looks like)

- [ ] Events are arriving under the correct customer
- [ ] You can find a recent event and identify the source

## Dashboards

- What dashboards get deployed during provisioning (if applicable)
- What “populated” looks like

## Alerts (starter set)

List 3–5 high-signal starter detections.

## Troubleshooting

If events aren’t showing up:

- confirm connector/external service is verified
- confirm routing/tenant association
- confirm index/stream assumptions
- confirm Graylog alert plumbing (if used)
