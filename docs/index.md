# SOCFortress CoPilot Documentation

This site contains two documentation tracks:

- **User Guide**: How to use CoPilot day-to-day (SOC operators) and how to configure sources/integrations (admins/engineers).
- **Developer / AI Agent Docs**: Architecture, data flows, schema, and extension playbooks for making safe changes.
