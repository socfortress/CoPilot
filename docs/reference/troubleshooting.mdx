# Troubleshooting index

This page is a **symptom-based index**. Find what you’re seeing, then follow the checks.

> Wireframe note: this is intentionally high-level. As we fill docs, each item will link to deeper pages with exact UI clicks and screenshots.

## Ingestion

### No endpoint logs (Wazuh)

Likely causes:
- Wazuh connector not verified
- agent not enrolled / offline
- indexing/storage issue
- tenant/customer association missing

What to check:
- CoPilot: Connectors → Wazuh status
- CoPilot: Agents shows host online
- Wazuh: agent status + manager logs
- Indexer/OpenSearch: index health

### No syslog / network logs

Likely causes:
- device not sending syslog
- collector not listening / firewall/ACL
- parsing pipeline not extracting fields
- routing/tenant association missing

What to check:
- device syslog destination IP/port
- collector receive logs
- Graylog input/stream/pipeline

### No third-party integration events (O365/Mimecast/etc.)

Likely causes:
- API credentials/scopes wrong
- export/collector not running
- routing/tenant association missing

What to check:
- CoPilot: External Services / Integration status
- credential permissions
- ingestion job logs (if applicable)

---

## Visualization

### Grafana dashboards are empty

Likely causes:
- Grafana connector not verified
- provisioning not completed
- index pattern/data source misconfigured
- data is not flowing yet

What to check:
- CoPilot: connector status
- customer provisioning status
- Grafana: data source points at correct indices

---

## Alerting

### Graylog alerts not showing in CoPilot

Likely causes:
- Graylog connector not verified
- event definitions not firing
- `gl-events*` not being written
- CoPilot not querying the correct index/pattern

What to check:
- CoPilot: Graylog connector status
- Graylog: event definitions + streams
- Indexer: `gl-events*` exists and has recent docs

---

## Incident workflow

### Can’t create cases / case workflow feels broken

Likely causes:
- permissions/RBAC
- missing required configuration

What to check:
- user permissions/roles
- customer/tenant context

---

## Response

### Velociraptor actions not working

Likely causes:
- Velociraptor connector not verified
- agent not enrolled in Velociraptor org
- permissions missing

What to check:
- CoPilot: Velociraptor connector status
- Velociraptor: client visibility
- CoPilot: agent metadata has velociraptor identifiers
