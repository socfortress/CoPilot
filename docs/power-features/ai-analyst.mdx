# AI analyst / AI-assisted investigation

CoPilot’s AI features are designed to reduce context switching and speed up common SOC workflows:
- understand an alert faster ("what am I looking at?")
- decide what to do next ("benign or investigate?")
- generate drafts for repetitive engineering tasks (exclusions/tuning)
- chat with your stack (Wazuh, Velociraptor, CoPilot) using natural language

---

## What it is

In the videos, AI in CoPilot shows up in two main ways:

### 1) AI analyst (alert-focused)

AI analyst is embedded directly into CoPilot’s alert experience.

Typical flow:
1) Open an alert
2) Select the impacted asset/hostname
3) Use **AI analyst** to generate context and suggested next steps

It can help:
- summarize what triggered the detection
- explain why the behavior can be suspicious
- suggest what to validate next (triage steps)

The same area can also support workflows like drafting **Wazuh exclusion rules** for noisy/expected behavior.

### 2) AI chatbot / “chat with your stack” (tool-assisted)

CoPilot can expose an AI chatbot that can interface with:
- **Wazuh Manager**
- **Wazuh Indexer (OpenSearch)**
- **Velociraptor**
- **CoPilot**

This makes it possible to ask questions like:
- “show me recent alerts for customer X”
- “pull surrounding events for this index document”
- “run a Velociraptor artifact on host Y”

…and have CoPilot handle the underlying API/tool calls.

The chatbot can also be extended with additional “tools” (as shown in the videos), such as:
- threat intelligence lookups (IP/domain reputation)
- cyber news summaries
- internal knowledge base search/summarization
- high-level attack surface/exposure checks

## Why this is a power feature

AI assistance is most valuable after your core stack is stable:
- alerts are flowing
- assets/customers are properly scoped
- investigation pivots work (index_id/index_name, artifacts, cases)

Once that foundation is in place, AI can:
- reduce time-to-understanding for analysts
- standardize triage narratives
- accelerate tuning (without living in XML/rules all day)

---

## Operator workflows (practical)

### Triage an alert faster

1) Open the alert and review key fields (command line, parent process, user, host)
2) Run **AI analyst** to get:
   - a plain-English explanation of the detection
   - what makes it suspicious
   - recommended validation steps
3) Decide:
   - escalate/investigate further, or
   - mark as expected (and consider tuning)

### Draft a Wazuh exclusion rule (noise reduction)

If an alert is expected/benign but noisy:
1) collect the key discriminators (image, command line pattern, user, parent, host group)
2) generate a draft exclusion rule
3) review it like code (avoid over-broad exclusions)
4) deploy + validate

### Chat with your stack (investigation + response)

Use the chatbot when you want to do “SOC glue work” quickly:
- ask questions against recent alerts
- pivot into index logs for context
- run Velociraptor collections/artifacts without leaving CoPilot

## Setup checklist (high level)

Exact steps depend on your CoPilot release, but the videos show a common pattern:

1) **Update your CoPilot deployment**
   - pull the latest images
   - update `docker-compose.yml` with the new AI/MCP service (if required)

2) **Configure AI provider access**
   - set your model provider API key(s) (example shown in the video: OpenAI)

3) **Configure stack connectivity for tool-assisted chat**
   - Wazuh Indexer (OpenSearch) URL + credentials
   - Wazuh Manager connection details (if used)
   - Velociraptor connection details

4) **Validate permissions + scoping**
   - ensure users can only summarize/ask questions over data they’re authorized to access (multi-tenant safety)

---

## Safety / guardrails

- Don’t paste secrets into prompts.
- Treat AI output as a draft: verify before acting.
- Be careful with exclusion rules: tune precisely to avoid blinding detections.
- Restrict access: AI can summarize sensitive customer data; enforce RBAC/tenant scoping.
