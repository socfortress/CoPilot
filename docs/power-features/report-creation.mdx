## What it is

CoPilot supports report creation, commonly via Grafana dashboards and PDF generation.

## Who this is for

- **Operator**: case-related evidence packets and summaries (depending on workflow)

## Inputs (what it needs)

- Grafana connector configured (for dashboard-backed reports)
- Customer provisioning completed (dashboards/org exist)

## Outputs (what you get)

- Report outputs (PDF/exports, depending on configuration)
- Shareable artifacts for customers and internal documentation

## Where it lives in the UI

- (Wireframe) This page will be updated with the exact menu path/route.

## Success criteria

- [ ] You can generate a report for a customer

## Safety / guardrails
