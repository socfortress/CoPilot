# Cloud security assessment (Scout Suite)

CoPilot can run **Scout Suite** scans and surface the resulting report inside the UI.

Scout Suite is an open-source cloud security assessment tool that scans a cloud account via provider APIs, identifies risky configurations, and generates a report with remediation guidance.

---

## Why this is a power feature

Cloud posture assessment is not required for the initial SIEM bring-up, but it becomes valuable once your core pipeline is healthy.

Use it for:
- periodic cloud posture reviews (monthly/quarterly)
- identifying misconfigurations and risky exposures
- producing a shareable “here’s what to fix next” report for stakeholders

---

## How it works in CoPilot (high level)

1) You create cloud credentials with read-only assessment permissions (provider-specific)
2) In CoPilot, you create a new cloud assessment report
3) CoPilot runs Scout Suite in the background
4) When complete, the report is listed and can be opened/viewed in CoPilot

---

## Supported providers

- **AWS**
- **Azure**
- **Google Cloud (GCP)**

CoPilot can run Scout Suite scans for these providers as long as the appropriate credentials and API permissions are in place.

---

## Setup checklist (AWS / Azure / GCP)

### 1) Create a dedicated Scout Suite cloud principal

Create a dedicated identity for assessments:
- **AWS:** IAM user/role
- **Azure:** App registration / service principal
- **GCP:** service account

Guidance:
- Use **least privilege**.
- Prefer read-only where possible.

Provider-specific credential setup (recommended):
- AWS: https://github.com/nccgroup/ScoutSuite/wiki/Amazon-Web-Services
- Azure: https://github.com/nccgroup/ScoutSuite/wiki/Azure
- GCP: https://github.com/nccgroup/ScoutSuite/wiki/Google-Cloud-Platform

### 2) Generate credentials

Create the credentials required for the provider you’re scanning.

Common patterns from the Scout Suite wiki:
- **AWS:** standard AWS credential sources (profiles in `~/.aws/credentials`, environment variables, role assumption, or explicit access keys)
- **Azure:** Azure CLI login, user-account browser login (MFA-friendly), or service principal (including file-based SDK auth)
- **GCP:** application-default user credentials or a service account key JSON

### 3) Run the scan in CoPilot

In CoPilot:
1) Open **Cloud security assessment**
2) Select provider type (AWS / Azure / GCP)
3) Set a report name
4) Enter credentials
5) Submit

The scan runs in the background. Runtime depends on the size of the cloud environment.

Operational tip (from the video):
- You can tail CoPilot container logs to see when report generation completes.
- Use Refresh in the UI; when done, the report appears in the list.

---

## Success criteria

- [ ] You can create a report and the scan completes
- [ ] The report shows in the UI after refresh
- [ ] The report content is accessible to authorized users

---

## Safety / guardrails

- Cloud posture reports can contain sensitive inventory details (accounts, resources, IAM relationships).
  - Restrict access (RBAC) appropriately.
- Use dedicated credentials and rotate them.
- Avoid storing long-lived keys if your environment supports roles/short-lived credentials.

---

## Troubleshooting

- Report never appears:
  - confirm credentials are valid
  - confirm required API permissions exist
  - check CoPilot container logs for Scout Suite errors

- Report takes a long time:
  - large environments can take longer to enumerate
  - rerun during a quieter window
