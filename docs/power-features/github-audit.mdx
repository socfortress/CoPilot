# GitHub audit

## What it is

CoPilot contains schema and capability to store GitHub audit-related data (wireframe).

## Who this is for

- **Admin / Platform**: org security posture and governance

## Inputs (what it needs)

- GitHub org access and permissions to collect audit/security signals (implementation-dependent)

## Outputs (what you get)

- Audit views / reports (to be documented)

## Where it lives in the UI

- (Wireframe) This page will be updated with the exact menu path/route.

## Success criteria

- [ ] GitHub audit data can be collected
- [ ] Data can be displayed and searched

## Safety / guardrails

- Treat audit exports as sensitive (users, access patterns, security events).

## Troubleshooting

- Confirm GitHub permissions/token scopes
- Confirm collection job is running and storing results
