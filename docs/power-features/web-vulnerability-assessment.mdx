title: Web vulnerability assessment (Nuclei)
description: Run Nuclei-based web vulnerability scans inside CoPilot and review findings with request/response detail.
---

CoPilot includes a web vulnerability scanning module powered by **Nuclei**.

It’s designed to give operators/admins a fast way to validate web exposure and identify common web/app misconfigurations across owned/authorized targets.

---

## Why this is a power feature

Web scanning is not required for initial SIEM bring-up, but it’s a high-leverage add-on for reducing attack surface.

Use it for:
- periodic external exposure reviews (what are we accidentally exposing?)
- validating suspected vulnerabilities during an incident
- confirming whether a customer-facing app has known weak configurations (TLS, headers, exposed endpoints)

---

## How it works in CoPilot (high level)

1) You enable the CoPilot Nuclei module
2) You submit a target host/domain (and any supported scan options)
3) CoPilot runs Nuclei in the background
4) Results are stored and displayed as a report
5) You can drill into each finding for evidence and reproduction detail

---

## Setup checklist

### 1) Enable the Nuclei module (Docker)

In the video walkthrough, Nuclei is enabled by adding the **CoPilot Nuclei module container** to your CoPilot `docker-compose.yml`, then running a compose up.

Success check:
- the Nuclei module container is running
- the **Web vulnerability assessment** entry becomes available in the UI

### 2) Confirm scanner reachability

The scanner runtime must be able to reach your targets.

Confirm:
- DNS resolution works from the scanner runtime
- egress is allowed to the target(s)
- you’re scoping to assets you own/have permission to scan

---

## Running a scan

Typical workflow (from the video):

1) Open **Web vulnerability assessment**
2) Select **Create new report** (if applicable)
3) Enter a target host/domain
   - you usually don’t need to include `http://` or `https://` if the UI accepts a host
4) Submit
5) Wait for completion, then **refresh** the page

---

## Understanding results

Once results are available, you can typically:
- see a list of findings (grouped by type)
- open a finding to review details

Per-finding detail often includes:
- description of what was detected
- affected URL
- the HTTP request/response evidence
- the **curl command** Nuclei used (useful for reproduction and follow-up testing)

This makes it easy to:
- validate the finding
- hand evidence to an app owner
- reproduce safely in a test environment

---

## Practical operator usage

A good operator loop:

1) Run a scan against a specific application
2) Identify quick wins (weak TLS/ciphers, exposed Swagger/OpenAPI, debug endpoints)
3) Create remediation tasks and validate closure by rescanning

---

## Safety / guardrails

- Only scan assets you **own** or have **explicit permission** to test.
- Scanning can trigger WAF blocks, rate limits, or availability impact.
  - start with a single target
  - schedule scans during a quiet window
  - avoid aggressive configurations by default

---

## Troubleshooting

- No results / scan never completes:
  - confirm the Nuclei module container is running
  - confirm the scanner can reach the target host
  - check CoPilot/Nuclei module logs

- False positives:
  - use the request/response + curl output to validate
  - tune templates/scan scope as needed
