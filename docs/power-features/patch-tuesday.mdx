# Microsoft Patch Tuesday

## What it is

CoPilot includes a Patch Tuesday experience to help operators/admins track and prioritize Microsoft monthly vulnerabilities.

## Who this is for

- **Admin / Platform**: triage exposure and prioritize remediation
- **Operator**: understand which CVEs matter during investigations

## Inputs (what it needs)

- Internet access for Patch Tuesday data fetch (implementation-dependent)
- No endpoint agent changes required

## Outputs (what you get)

- Cycle summary (current/recent)
- Search and prioritization helpers

## Where it lives in the UI

- **Agents → Patch Tuesday**
- Route: `/patch-tuesday`

Operator walkthrough (UI guide):
- [Patch Tuesday (Microsoft)](/user/ui/agents-patch-tuesday)

## Success criteria

- [ ] Patch Tuesday data loads
- [ ] You can open a cycle and view prioritized items
- [ ] You can search for a CVE and get results

## Safety / guardrails

- Patch Tuesday prioritization is guidance. Always validate against your environment and asset exposure.

## Troubleshooting

- If data won’t load:
  - verify outbound connectivity (if required)
  - check connector/service health (if applicable)
  - retry with a different cycle (if UI supports it)
