title: Power features
description: Add-on capabilities that extend CoPilot beyond the core ingest→detect→respond loop.

These features make CoPilot more powerful, but they’re not required for the initial SIEM bring-up.

If you’re still onboarding, start with the guided checklist: [Start here](/getting-started/start-here).

## How to think about power features

Power features usually fit into one of these buckets:

- **Exposure management** (patch/vuln posture)
- **Assessment** (cloud/web scanning outputs)
- **Reporting** (shareable artifacts)
- **Acceleration** (AI assistance)

They typically have additional inputs (connectors, permissions, targets) and should be rolled out after your core ingest→alerting path is healthy.
