description: Source-by-source setup guides and expectations for what data, dashboards, and alerts you get in CoPilot.

# Integrations

This section is a **catalog**.

Pick a source, follow a short setup guide, then validate that:

- logs are ingesting
- dashboards populate (after provisioning)
- alerting can be enabled (built-in or custom)

If you’re brand new, start with the guided checklist: [Start here](/getting-started/start-here).

## The mental model

Almost every integration follows this pattern:

1. **Ingest** events (API integration or syslog)
2. Store events in your SIEM datastore (Wazuh Indexer / OpenSearch-backed)
3. (Often) build alerts in **Graylog** → alerts land in `gl-events*`
4. CoPilot shows alerts in **Incident Management → Alerts** → operators open **Cases**
