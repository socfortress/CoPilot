# First wins (30 minutes)

If you’re onboarding a new environment, aim for these milestones.

## 1) Operator: triage an alert → open a case
- Go to **Incident Management → Alerts**
- Open an alert and review the context
- Create or link a **Case**

**Docs:** [Incident alerts](/user/ui/incident-alerts) · [Incident cases](/user/ui/incident-cases)

**Video track:** [Operator track](/user/videos#operator-track)

## 2) Admin: provision a customer
Provision a tenant and verify it appears correctly in the Customers view.

**Docs:** [Customer provisioning](/user/customer-provisioning)

## 3) Admin: connect an integration / connector
Connect at least one data source and verify it shows up in CoPilot.

**Docs:**
- [3rd‑party integrations](/user/ui/external-third-party-integrations)
- [Network connectors](/user/ui/external-network-connectors)

## 4) Validate indices and retention
Make sure the backing indices/patterns exist and data is landing where expected.

**Docs:** [Indices management](/user/ui/indices-management)
