# Roles & mental model

CoPilot is easiest to learn if you separate it into **two jobs**:

1) **Operate incidents** (alerts → cases → evidence → response)
2) **Make incidents possible** (connect sources/integrations so alerts flow)

## SOC operator / analyst

You spend most of your time in **Incident Management**.

You care about:
- Is this alert real?
- What’s the blast radius?
- What evidence do I need?
- What do I do next?

**Start here:**
- [Operator quickstart](/user/operators-quickstart)
- [Incident alerts (UI reference)](/user/ui/incident-alerts)
- [Cases (UI reference)](/user/ui/incident-cases)
- Videos: [Operator track](/user/videos#operator-track)

## Admin / engineer

You care about **data onboarding and reliability**.

You care about:
- Are sources connected and healthy?
- Are parsing / streams / pipelines configured correctly?
- Are indices and retention behaving?
- Is each customer/tenant provisioned correctly?

**Start here:**
- [Admin/Engineer quickstart](/user/admins-quickstart)
- [Customer provisioning](/user/customer-provisioning)
- Videos: [Admin/Engineer track](/user/videos#adminengineer-track)

## Developer / AI agent

You are extending or modifying CoPilot.

You care about:
- Architecture + data flows
- Schema changes (Alembic as source of truth)
- Adding a connector safely

**Start here:**
- [Developer start here](/developer/start-here)
