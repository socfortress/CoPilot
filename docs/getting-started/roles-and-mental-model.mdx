title: Roles & mental model
description: How to think about CoPilot as a SOC operator vs. admin/engineer vs. developer.
---

CoPilot is easiest to learn if you separate it into **two jobs**:

1) **Operate incidents** (alerts → cases → evidence → response)
2) **Make incidents possible** (connect sources/integrations so alerts flow)

---

## The mental model (visual)

CoPilot becomes intuitive when you see it as **two loops** that share the same data:

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Admin / Platform loop" icon="gear">
    You make detection possible.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Connect & verify">
        Integrations + syslog connectors are healthy.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Ingest & route">
        Streams/pipelines route logs where they should go.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Provision & visualize">
        Customers/tenants, dashboards, indices, retention.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Enable alerting">
        Event definitions + notifications are configured.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Tune & maintain">
        Reduce noise, validate coverage, keep things reliable.

        New alert lands in Incident Management.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Triage">
        Decide: true positive? priority? scope?
      </Step>
      <Step title="Case work">
        Create a case, collect artifacts/evidence.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Respond">
        Contain, eradicate, recover.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Feedback">
        Feed improvements back into tuning/detections.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Card>
</Columns>

### How alerts become cases (the shared pipeline)

<Steps>
  <Step title="1) Data arrives">
    Endpoints (Wazuh), API integrations (O365/Mimecast/Huntress/CrowdStrike), and syslog devices (FortiGate/PAN‑OS/ASA).
  </Step>
  <Step title="2) Normalize & route">
    Graylog streams/pipelines normalize fields and route logs.
  </Step>
  <Step title="3) Detect">
    Graylog Event Definitions evaluate conditions and generate events.
  </Step>
  <Step title="4) Persist">
    Alerts are written to `gl-events*`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="5) Operate">
    CoPilot surfaces alerts → operators create/work cases → response.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## SOC operator / analyst

You spend most of your time in **Incident Management**.

You care about:
- Is this alert real?
- What’s the blast radius?
- What evidence do I need?
- What do I do next?

**Start here:**
- [Operator quickstart](/user/operators-quickstart)
- [Incident alerts (UI reference)](/user/ui/incident-alerts)
- [Cases (UI reference)](/user/ui/incident-cases)
- Videos: [Operator track](/user/videos#operator-track)

## Admin / engineer

You care about **data onboarding and reliability**.

You care about:
- Are sources connected and healthy?
- Are parsing / streams / pipelines configured correctly?
- Are indices and retention behaving?
- Is each customer/tenant provisioned correctly?

**Start here:**
- [Admin/Engineer quickstart](/user/admins-quickstart)
- [Customer provisioning](/user/customer-provisioning)
- Videos: [Admin/Engineer track](/user/videos#adminengineer-track)

## Developer / AI agent

You are extending or modifying CoPilot.

You care about:
- Architecture + data flows
- Schema changes (Alembic as source of truth)
- Adding a connector safely

**Start here:**
- [Developer start here](/developer/start-here)
