description: A guided checklist to get logs flowing, dashboards populated, and alerts/cases working in SOCFortress CoPilot.
---

# Start here

This is the **primary onboarding checklist** for CoPilot.

CoPilot sits on top of an open-source SIEM stack. To get value fast, you want this order:

1) **Ingest** (endpoints + integrations + syslog)
2) **Visualize** (dashboards)
3) **Detect** (alerts)
4) **Respond** (alerts → cases → IR)

If you’re unsure what role you are, read [Roles & mental model](/getting-started/roles-and-mental-model) first.

---

## Success definition (what “done” looks like)

You’re “onboarded” when:

- [ ] You can confirm **endpoint logs** are arriving (Wazuh)
- [ ] You can confirm **integration/syslog logs** are arriving (External Services / Network Connectors)
- [ ] You can open a **Grafana dashboard** that is populated with real data
- [ ] A **Graylog alert** appears in CoPilot (**Incident Management → Alerts**)
- [ ] An operator can open a **case** from an alert and track investigation work

---

## 0) Prereqs (10 minutes)

Do these before troubleshooting anything else.

- [ ] In CoPilot, configure and verify **Connectors** (Wazuh, Graylog, Grafana, Velociraptor).
  - If a connector can’t verify, stop here and fix connectivity/credentials.
- [ ] Decide your **customer code** convention (short, stable, no spaces).
  - You’ll use this for routing/indexing/provisioning.

## 1) Ingest logs (make data exist)

### 1A) Endpoints — Wazuh (usually first)

**Goal:** endpoints are enrolled and reporting; CoPilot shows them as healthy.

Checklist:
- [ ] Enroll at least 1 endpoint (Windows or Linux) into Wazuh.
- [ ] Confirm the endpoint appears in CoPilot under **Agents** and shows online/healthy.
- [ ] Confirm the agent is associated with the correct tenant/customer context.

Success criteria:
- You can point to **one real endpoint** in CoPilot and say “this host is actively producing telemetry.”

Next (UI reference):
- [Agents](/user/ui/agents)
- [Agent groups](/user/ui/agents-groups)

### 1B) Third‑party integrations — API sources

Examples: Office 365, Mimecast, Huntress, CrowdStrike.

**Goal:** events are arriving under the correct customer scope.

Checklist:
- [ ] Configure at least 1 integration under **External Services**.
- [ ] Confirm events are flowing (don’t worry about dashboards yet).

Success criteria:
- You can find at least **one recent event** for the integration and tie it to a customer.

Next (UI reference):
- [External services](/user/ui/external-services)
- [3rd party integrations](/user/ui/external-third-party-integrations)

### 1C) Network connectors — syslog

**Goal:** syslog events arrive from at least one device/source.

Checklist:
- [ ] Configure a network connector.
- [ ] Confirm syslog events are arriving and are tenant-aware (routed/tagged correctly).

Success criteria:
- You can identify the source device + see fresh events in the expected location.

Next (UI reference):
- [Network connectors](/user/ui/external-network-connectors)

---

## 2) Visualize (make data understandable)

CoPilot uses **Grafana** for dashboards. During **customer provisioning**, CoPilot can deploy **templated dashboards** so you get immediate visibility.

Checklist:
- [ ] Verify the **Grafana connector**.
- [ ] Run **customer provisioning** for a test customer.
- [ ] Confirm dashboards are deployed into the customer’s Grafana org.
- [ ] Open at least 1 dashboard and confirm it’s populated (not empty panels).

Success criteria:
- You can show a dashboard with **real, current** data for a specific customer.

## 3) Detect (make data actionable)

CoPilot uses **Graylog** for searching and alerting.

Mental model:
- ingestion → streams/pipelines → event definitions → alerts written to `gl-events*`
- CoPilot reads those into **Incident Management → Alerts**

Checklist:
- [ ] Verify the **Graylog connector**.
- [ ] Ensure alert plumbing exists (built-in definitions or create one custom).
- [ ] Trigger a test event and confirm an alert is created.
- [ ] Confirm the alert is visible in CoPilot under **Incident Management → Alerts**.

Success criteria:
- A new alert appears in CoPilot and you can explain “what fired” + “what data it was based on.”

Next (UI reference):
- [Graylog management](/user/ui/graylog-management)
- [Incident alerts](/user/ui/incident-alerts)

---

## 4) Respond (alerts → cases)

Checklist:
- [ ] Open an alert.
- [ ] Create a case from it.
- [ ] Add at least one note/comment/evidence link.
- [ ] Assign/track status so it’s obvious what’s being worked.

Success criteria:
- An operator can manage an investigation end-to-end without leaving CoPilot.

Next (UI reference):
- [Incident cases](/user/ui/incident-cases)

---

## 5) Endpoint IR (Velociraptor)

Velociraptor provides response capabilities: remote commands, artifact collection, and evidence gathering.

Checklist:
- [ ] Verify the **Velociraptor connector**.
- [ ] Run one basic artifact collection against a test endpoint.
- [ ] Confirm you can retrieve/view results in CoPilot.

Success criteria:
- You can collect at least one artifact and attach/associate results to investigation work.

Next:
- Velociraptor-focused walkthroughs in [Videos](/user/videos)

## 6) Expand (power features)

Once the core SIEM loop is working, layer in these modules:

- Vulnerability + SCA views (Wazuh-backed)
- Microsoft Patch Tuesday prioritization
- Cloud security assessment outputs (Scout Suite)
- Web vulnerability assessment (Nuclei)
- GitHub audit
- AI-assisted reporting / report creation

(We’ll link each of these to dedicated pages as we wireframe them.)
