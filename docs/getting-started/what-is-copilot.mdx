# What is CoPilot?

SOCFortress CoPilot is a **single pane of glass** for operating an open‑source SOC/SIEM stack.

It sits above tools like **Wazuh**, **Graylog**, **Velociraptor**, **Grafana**, and **Shuffle** and helps you:

- **Operate incidents**: alerts → cases → evidence → response
- **Onboard data**: customer/tenant provisioning, integrations, and connectors
- **Reduce context switching** with a consistent UI and workflow

## Who is it for?

    Daily triage and case work.

  <Card title="Admins / engineers" icon="gear">
    Data onboarding, integrations, indices, and reliability.

    Extend CoPilot safely (connectors, schema changes, data flows).

## The mental model

Think of CoPilot as two loops:

1. **Incident loop** (operator): detect → triage → investigate → contain
2. **Ingestion loop** (admin): connect → route → normalize → validate

Next: read [Roles & mental model](/getting-started/roles-and-mental-model) and then pick a quickstart.
